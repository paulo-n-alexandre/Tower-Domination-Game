# Tower Domination Game

Game developed for the course of Methodology and Game Development, where I worked with 2 other developers, 3 artists and 1 writer. We developed the game from scratch, with study of the market, the making of low-fidelity prototypes and user testing, and at the end, we developed it using Unity Engine. 

It is characterized as a roguelike deck-builder game, with a design combining the systems of Slay the Spire and Dominion. It is further described on the following page: https://pnaa.itch.io/tower-domination

In this directory, it is presented the documents and low-fidelity prototypes produced in order to achieve our final game. To play the game, you can download directly from the itch.io page, extract the downloaded folder and run the TowerDomination.exe.
